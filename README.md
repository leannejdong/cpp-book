# Book summary and thoughts on C++

My summary is a combination of the following books:

* "A Tour of C++ (2nd Edition)" by Bjarnes Stroustrup

* " C++20 Recipes A Problem-Solution approach "  by Bruce Sutherland

* Thoughts from various programmers I met.

* Examples are provided with links to compiler explorer

To compile, you can either use a Makefile or with latexmk via the command `latexmk --shell -escape -pvc -pdf mycpp.tex`.

(If you are using Make, please make sure you read the Makefile and choose the correct pdf viewer.)
